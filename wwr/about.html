In addition to being very safety-minded, our guides will dazzle you with their storytelling, their knowledge of canyon history and flora and fauna, as well as their culinary prowess as riverside chefs. Guides have a genuine enthusiasm for Idaho’s Salmon River that is infectious. You will begin the river trip as strangers. </p>

                        <p>Whitewater Rafting is the culmination of a lifetime spent in Idaho’s wilderness on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, Main Salmon River, and Lower Salmon River. As a fifth-generation Idahoan, Dustin comes from a family with a long and rich history of farming, ranching, logging, and recreating in Idaho. Some of his earliest memories are fishing, hiking, and exploring the wild places and rivers where Idaho River Adventures now operates. During his college years, Dustin was introduced to guiding and soon realized it.</p>
